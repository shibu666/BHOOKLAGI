            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">When in Amritsar, start out with the Golden Temple. The best time to visit is during the morning when the Guru Granth Sahib is brought to the inner sanctum. After offering your prayers, head over to the langar, the largest free kitchen in the world! The volunteers here cook and serve a simple meal of dal, roti, sabzi and kheer to lakhs of devotees each day. Even if you don’t have the time for langar, don’t leave the Kara Prasad on your way out. You will have to jostle among a large crowd for this ghee-laden delicacy but a bite of it will prove to be totally worth it!

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Amritsar is synonymous with Kulchas, the maida bread baked in a tandoor. Located beside the Golden Temple and the Wagah Border, the All India Famous is a place to have the butter drenched, potato and cauliflower stuffed kulcha. Touted by some to be a foodie’s pilgrimage spot, this place has been serving just kulchas over the many years of its existence. You can have kulchas for all your meals of the day here and each of it will be an experience incomparable to the other. They serve kulcha alongside chana masala, sliced onions and tamarind chutney. It is a perfect place for breakfast or lunch since they tend to run out of kulchas by 2 pm!!

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Kulcha Land located at Ranjit Avenue might confuse you with its name, but the kulchas here are as authentic as they get. When you visit this place you won’t need a menu card, because all they serve here is different varieties of kulchas. They have been serving fresh-off-the-tandoor kulchas since before the partition. Don’t be surprised if you find a Tempo Traveller full of tourists unloading at Kulcha Land! The crispy kulchas are simply mouth-watering and washing it down with lassi will simply make your day.  Kulcha Land is undoubtedly one of the best places to eat in Amritsar.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">For all the people who prefer a meatier version of Kulcha, Friends Dhaba located at the Queens Road is the place to rush off to. They serve Keema Naan with gravy and, of course, dollops of butter. The keema kulcha has a crispy exterior and a spicy keema mix. (I can already feel my mouth watering!) These kulchas simply disappear in your mouth, yes it’s that tasty.  Don’t forget to slather it with butter before dipping it in gravy, and have a near-spiritual experience.

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Serving some of Amritsar’s best kababs, Surjit Food Plaza has been in existence on the Lawrence Road for over seventy years. It has recently been turned into a fancy restaurant with proper seating and air-conditioning, and a menu that served even Chinese staple dishes like sweet corn soup! What’s really popular though is the melt-in-your-mouth Shammi Kabab and Mutton Tikka. What makes them so unique is the totally different style of cooking. The tikkas are first cooked in tandoor, then sautéed with ghee on the tawa and has a secret masala handed down over the generations.
